# restlogin

A Flutter application that provides a secure login mechanism using the https://dummyjson.com/auth/login endpoint. The app validates user credentials, authenticates the user, and then displays the user's information on the Home Page. This project demonstrates secure authentication and effective UI for user information display, using Flutter and Dio for API communication.
